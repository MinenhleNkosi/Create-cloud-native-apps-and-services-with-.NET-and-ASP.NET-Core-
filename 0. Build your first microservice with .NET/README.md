# Microservices
Microservice applications are composed of *small*, *independently versioned*, and *scalable* customer-focused services that communicate with each other by using standard protocols and well-defined interfaces. Each microservice typically encapsulates simple **business logic**, which you can scale out or in. You **test**, **deploy**, and **manage** the microservice independently. Smaller teams develop a microservice based on a customer scenario and choose the technologies that they use. Here we will learn how to build our first microservice by using .NET.

## Learning objectives
You'll be able to:
* Explain what microservices are.
* Know the various technologies that are involved in microservices and how they relate to each other.
* Build a microservice by using .NET.

## Prerequisites
* Familiarity with command-line-based applications.
* Familiarity with basic Docker concepts.
